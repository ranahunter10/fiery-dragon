**Phase:** 0, ground truth (platform fixed and measured; decisions written as ADRs; no product code yet)

## Phase 0 gate

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Target VM built from a script, kernel pinned | ✅ done | [`00-vm-baseline.txt`](evidence/phase0/00-vm-baseline.txt), [`create-vm.ps1`](../tools/vm/create-vm.ps1), [runbook](runbooks/vm-setup.md) |
| P1: attach points exist (BTF + ftrace) | ✅ done | [`02`](evidence/phase0/02-p1-attach-points.txt), [`04`](evidence/phase0/04-p1b-fexit-check.txt) |
| P2: BPF features | ✅ done; `bpf_get_func_ret` (INF) and `bpf_d_path` from fexit (OPEN) need a real load | [`03`](evidence/phase0/03-p2-feature-probe.txt), [notes](evidence/phase0/README.md) |
| P3: LSM / lockdown | ✅ done | [`00`](evidence/phase0/00-vm-baseline.txt) |
| P4: clocksource | ✅ done | [`00`](evidence/phase0/00-vm-baseline.txt) |
| P5: disk bandwidth | ✅ done: min 63.7 MB/s, ±25 % under Hyper-V | [`05`](evidence/phase0/05-p5-disk.txt) |
| P6: argv source at exec | ⏳ open | — |
| P7: connect/accept hook layer | ⏳ open | — |
| P8: 32-bit compat I/O visible to fexit | ⏳ open (needs `gcc-multilib`) | — |
| P9: io_uring completion path | ⏳ open (needs `liburing-dev`) | — |
| **P10: event-rate census** | 🔧 v1 light set (E-0025/26); **v2: all 20 new hooks verified** (E-0032); rates varied 0.17-0.70x between runs from **host drift**, not from the hooks or concurrency (A/B serial E-0035, parallel E-0036). Tracing cost on fixed work: +13-30 %. Next: Hyper-V on/off + interleaved untraced baselines, then projected rates = untraced syscalls × selectivity | [v1](evidence/census/2026-10-24T221732Z-light/README.md), [v2](evidence/census/2026-10-24T224617Z-v2/README.md) |
| P11: Python wheels on 3.14 | ⏳ open | — |
| P12: untraced baselines | 🔧 Hyper-V A-B-A done (E-0038..41). Warm-up re-run (E-0043..45): warm-up fix works, but every row CV 12-29 %; same-state exec runs differ up to 3.3x, so the Hyper-V attribution is withdrawn (E-0044 corrects E-0038). Census probe slows `find` in every pair, size not measurable. **Overhead protocol decided (E-0046); to implement** | [A-B-A](evidence/baseline/2026-10-25-hyperv-ABA/README.md), [warm re-run](evidence/baseline/2026-10-25-hyperv-on-warm/README.md) |
| ADR process (ADR-0000, template, index) | ✅ done | `docs/decisions/` |
| Fresh journals: engineering log, research register | ✅ started | `docs/journal/`, `docs/research/` |
| ADR-0001…0013 written and reviewed | ⏳ open | `docs/decisions/README.md` (planned list) |
| ADR-0014: "capture v1 is enough for Layer 3" cut line | ⏳ open | — |

Raw phase-0 evidence: [`docs/evidence/phase0/`](evidence/phase0/README.md), byte for byte with `SHA256SUMS`.

## Next step

1. ✅ Bootstrap merged (PR #1). The maintainer sets squash-only merging and protects `main` with a ruleset.
2. ✅ PR #2: ADR process and fresh journals.
3. ✅ Phase-0 evidence imported.
4. ✅ VM creation script and runbook.
5. PR: evidence-capture scripts under `tools/vm/` (closes the runbook's known gap).
6. ✅ Census probe + summarizer, validated on the VM.
7. ✅ Census workload runner + light workloads.
8. ✅ Light set run on the VM; results in `docs/evidence/census/2026-10-24T221732Z-light/`.
9. ✅ This PR: census v2 (META, NET intent, capability), known-ops self-check, attach pre-flight; VM run: all 20 hooks deliver (E-0032); the rate drop vs v1 is not caused by the v2 hooks (E-0035, correcting E-0033).
9a. ✅ Serial and parallel A/B: no large probe effect (+13-30 %); the census-to-census gap is host drift (E-0035, E-0036). Per-family bisection not needed now.
10. PR: service workloads (Nginx, Redis, kernel build).
11. ✅ Hyper-V A-B-A (P12) with `bench/baseline/`; results and warm-up fix in this PR.
12. ✅ Host state decided: Hyper-V on, relative numbers only (E-0042).
13. ✅ Warm-up re-run (this PR): no quotable overhead on this host with 3 rounds; new protocol decided (E-0046).
14. Small probes built, waiting for the VM run: P6 argv and P8 compat (branch `bench/probes-p6-p8`), P11 wheels (branch `bench/probe-p11-wheels`). P7 and P9 are covered by census v2.
15. Then ADR-0001…0014.

## Decisions taken, ADR still to write

1. **libbpf:** vendor the latest 1.7.x tag (matches bpftool 7.7, which generates our skeletons). Goes into ADR-0002. *(2026-10-25, E-0013)*
2. **Swap:** off only while measuring, recorded in each run's conditions. Goes into ADR-0012. *(2026-10-25)*
3. **Hyper-V:** stays on; a paired on/off experiment decides later. Goes into ADR-0012. *(2026-10-25)*
4. **Journals:** CSV in the repo. *(2026-10-25)*
5. **Measurement host state:** Hyper-V on (everyday safe state). Quote relative results only (overhead %, selectivity, loss, class mix, interleaved in one session); no absolute rates from this laptop. Goes into ADR-0012. *(2026-10-25, E-0042)*

6. **Overhead protocol:** each round runs traced and untraced back to back, plus an A/A control arm (a second untraced run). Report the median and range of the per-round paired ratios, use at least 7 rounds, and claim an effect only above that run's own A/A noise floor. CV stays as a drift indicator only. Goes into ADR-0012. *(2026-10-25, E-0046)*
7. **Census-probe overhead is no longer measured.** The next overhead number comes from the Phase-1 probe. *(2026-10-25, E-0047)*
8. **`gcc-multilib` is installed on the VM** after a snapshot, for P8's 32-bit variant. *(2026-10-25, E-0048)*

## Decisions waiting

None open right now.
